# Sublime/Oz

[Oz language](http://mozart.github.io/) support for [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

## Features

  * Syntax Highlighting - detects files matching the pattern `*.oz`.

## Automatic Installation

**(Pending PR Acceptance)** Sublime/Oz is available from [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Oz) under the name `Oz`.

## Manual Installation

Download this repo as an archive or `git clone` it under the `Packages` directory under your Sublime user path.

On Windows, this is something like `C:\Users\%USER_NAME%\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3\Packages`.

Once the `sublime-shen` package is in place, just restart Sublime, and it should be ready to go.

## Future Work

  * Snippets
  * Build/Run
  * Formatting

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome. The latest version of Sublime should have everything you need to develop and test enhancements to this package.
